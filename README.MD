REST library over express.js

##About

Simple API library over [express.js](http://expressjs.com/).

##Where is the manual?

I've just started with moving my library to the package and the documentation for the project is in TBD state. If
you read this paragraph and you need something simple for REST API, please [email me](mailto:max.kitsch@gmail.com) and
I will speed up the process.

##Changes
